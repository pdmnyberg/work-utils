# TMD - a new version of the Training Metrics Database
It aims to:

- Describe the **audience demographic** being reached by ELIXIR-badged training events,
- Assess the **quality** of ELIXIR-badged training events directly after they have taken place,
- Evaluate the longer term **impact** that ELIXIR-badged training events have had on the work of training participants.


# The way here
- Started as a hackathon in Ljubljana last year
- Discussions have been ongoing
- Additional development in Q2 this year to add data upload

# The Traning Metrics Dtabase
- Look at it

# Challenges
- Improving the strictness of the dataset
- Using Django while learning how
- Making sure we import all the old data correctly while restructuring
- Finding a solutions with very limited time

# Thank you
- A good learning experience
- Great collaboration within the Training Platform WP2
